Problem: Container With Most Water (LeetCode #11)

Observation:
1. Given an array of heights, each index represents a line on the x-axis.
2. We need to find two lines that, along with the x-axis, form a container holding the **maximum water**.
3. The area between two lines = height * width
   - height = min(height[i], height[j])
   - width = j - i

Approach:
1. Brute Force:
   - Check area for all pairs (i, j).
   - Time: O(n^2)
2. Optimal (Two Pointer Approach):
   - Use two pointers `i = 0`, `j = n - 1`.
   - Compute area = min(height[i], height[j]) * (j - i).
   - Move the pointer with the **smaller height**, because increasing the smaller height might increase the area.
   - Keep track of the maximum area found.

Steps Followed:
1. Initialize two pointers and `water = 0`.
2. While (i < j):
   - Calculate area.
   - Update maximum area.
   - Move the pointer with smaller height.
3. Return the maximum area.

Time Complexity:
- Brute Force: O(n^2)
- Optimal (Two Pointer): O(n)

Space Complexity:
- O(1)

ðŸ‘‰ It's a classic **two-pointer** problem showing how narrowing search space smartly gives linear-time optimization.
